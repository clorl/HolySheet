# Holy Sheet - Easy online character sheets for Tabletop RPGs

I'm sick of the complexity of VTTs and hosting character sheets in an easy to edit way online.
What I want : 
- Upload PDF (can be form-fillable)
- Add fields and annotate in the browser
- Everything is saved and can be viewed by the GM live

That's it.

It's meant to be self-hosted but if it gets a little clout, I'll start a Patreon or something to host it online for free-ish if possible.
